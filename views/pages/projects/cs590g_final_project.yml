      <p>
          This is not just a tradition Tower Defense Game. We designed 3 levels to
          give players three different game modes.

      </b></p>
      <p>
          Level 1 is a traditional tower defense game. 3 waves of enemies, 3 types
          of turrets, and 3 types of enemies. Each turret can be upgraded once or
          sold.
      </p>
      <p><b>
          <span style="color: deeppink"> 2 - Untitled Tower Attack </span>
      </b></p>
      <p>
          Level 2 provides players with an opportunity to control the attackers
          and to play a third person action game.
      </p>

          <span style="color: deeppink"> 3 - Unlimited Random Tower Defense </span>
      </b></p>
      <p>
          We implemented map generator in Level 3. The map is generated by path
          finding algorithms and enemies after wave 3 are spawned randomly.
          Unlimited waves and no winning conditions.
      </p>

          Made with Unity.
