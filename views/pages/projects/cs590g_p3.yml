      <p>
          The goal of the game is that Claire should arrive at the target zone
          (EndZone) to save her cat, while avoiding the apples thrown at her from
          the turrets.
      </p>
      <p>Claire loses one life (out of five) when an apple hits her. If she loses
          all five, then she "dies".
      </p>
      <p>
          Made with Unity.
